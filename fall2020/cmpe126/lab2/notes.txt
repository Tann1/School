1. What operators should be overloaded for elemType in your implementation?
	Considering that Triple class has member functions that involve getting the
	min, max, and unique elements it's important to overload the comparision 
	operators. For example, ==, <=, >= are all important to overload for an elemType.

2. Can you make a triple using the Vector2D dicussed in class without modification? If so, why?
   if not, what modifications will you need to make?
	This questions is partially answer by the previous question.To reiterate it's 
	important to understand what kind of services are offered by Triple through it's member
	functions. For instance, Vector2D has the > overloaded so it might work to get min and max
 	if you finnese with the logic. Though getting unique number of elements might prove to be 
	a challenge. Not the mention the contains() function heavily relies on == operator to do
	the heavy lifting. Basically, any operators I've mentioned would need to be overloaded
	in Vector2D in order to work consistently with class Triple.
