part 1 

base case string size being <= 1
compare first and last index with each other
if they're not same then return false

erase first and last element
pass on the modified string recursively 


part 3
No I feel like doing it iteratively would be much eaiser conceptually 
and implementation wise. You can use a while with the indexes for the start and end
as the condition for it.
