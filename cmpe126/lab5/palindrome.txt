part 1 

base case string size being <= 1
if base case then return true
compare first and last index with each other
if they're not same then return false

erase first and last element
pass on the modified string recursively 


part 3
Complexity would be O(n) this comes from the fact that you'd do n/2 recursive
calls but since we discards all the const and only consider the highest term
it'd be O(n).
